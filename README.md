## Description

This Flutter app is designed to make managing your contacts simple and seamless, whether you're online or offline. It combines a clean, user-friendly interface with smart features to ensure you always have access to your contacts. Here's what makes it stand out:

- **Smooth Data Loading**: The app starts by fetching a small number of contacts from an API and loads more as you scroll down. This keeps the experience fast and responsive while making it easy to explore all your contacts.

- **Works Offline Too**: Don’t worry if you lose internet access! The app automatically switches to offline mode, showing contacts saved in a local database so you can keep using it without any interruptions.

- **Real-Time Network Awareness**: Using the connectivity_plus package, the app detects whether you’re online or offline and adjusts accordingly. You’ll even get a helpful toast notification if you go offline.

- **Beautiful, Responsive Design**: Whether you’re using a phone or a tablet, the app adapts perfectly to your screen size. Contacts are displayed in neat, modern cards with details like profile pictures, names, and email addresses.

- **Quick Access to Details**: Tap on any contact to view their full details on a dedicated page, making it easy to stay connected.

This app is all about reliability and simplicity, giving you a smooth and enjoyable experience while keeping your contacts easily accessible at all times.
